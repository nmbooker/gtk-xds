A collection of patches for adding direct (drag-and-drop) save to standard GtkFileChoosers

At the moment, the implementation is far from perfect.

The patches in patches-gtk-3.4 apply cleanly against GTK 3.4, but should
apply to newer releases too but might need some tweaking.

Clone gtk+ from git and check out branch gtk-3-4, then make a branch
so you can easily revert changes later.

```
$ git clone git://git.gnome.org/gtk+
$ git clone git://github.com/nmbooker/gtk-xds
$ cd gtk+
$ git checkout gtk-3-4
$ git checkout -b gtk-3-4-xds
```

Then apply each patch in turn with ```patch -p1```, e.g. the first one:

```
$ patch -p1 < ../gtk-xds/patches-gtk-3.4/0001-Added-icon-that-changes-current-path-to-dropped-on-d.patch
```

If contributing, please fork this and only ADD new patch files generated by:

```
 git format-patch gtk-3-4
```

and be sure to keep the number prefixes in sequence.  DO NOT change existing
.patch files.

Suggestions on how best to manage the patches (I'm sure keeping .patch 
files in the repository isn't the best way) welcome in the Issues tracker.

The patches also apply nicely to Ubuntu's gtk+3-0 source package in precise,
at least it does for 3.4.2, but you have to dpkg-source --commit after
applying the patches to make it play ball.
Once debuild has run, dpkg -i libgtk-3-{dev,0}*.deb will give you drag
and drop save in GTK+3 applications such as gedit.

A similar patch set for gtk+2 would be good, as a lot of apps still use
gtk2.  I targeted gtk3 first because there's more chance the gtk people
themselves might like to use my code for a proper implementation.
